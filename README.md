# Project Overview

My project is a responsive web application that displays upcoming and recommended events. It seamlessly adapts to both desktop and mobile screen sizes to provide users with an optimal viewing experience. 

### Technologies Used:

- **React JS:** I chose React JS for its effectiveness in building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With its component-based architecture, React enables me to create reusable UI components, making development more efficient.

- **Material-UI:** I utilized Material-UI to ensure that my web application is responsive and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. Material-UI provides a set of pre-designed React components with a modern and sleek design, enabling me to rapidly develop a user-friendly interface.

### Key Features:

- **Upcoming Events:** Users can view a list of upcoming events, including details such as event name, date, location, and distance.

- **Recommended Events:** The application also showcases recommended events based on user preferences or other relevant criteria.

- **Responsive Design:** My website is designed to seamlessly adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### How It Works:

1. The website fetches event data from the provided APIs, ensuring that users have access to the latest information about upcoming and recommended events.

2. Using React JS, I dynamically render the fetched event data to create an intuitive and interactive user interface.

3. Material-UI components are utilized to design and structure the web application, ensuring responsiveness and modern aesthetics.

Overall, my project combines the power of React JS and Material-UI to deliver a user-friendly and visually appealing web application for discovering upcoming and recommended events.
